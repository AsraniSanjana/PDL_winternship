to detect object xyz
change code at line number 20 in LineYolo_main.py: the video file 
then at line no.68, change the class name for that object.

(yolo files mei class specific code is inside the main files)

(efficientdet code mei class specific code is inside utils.py)

the tracker.py is to assign an id to each object detected, so that it can be counted if he/she has crossed the line yet or not.
